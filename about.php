		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Eric Henke is a Seattle-born, Chicago-based stencil artist, creating stenciled paintings for the better part of a decade.  Using a combination of digital manipulation and old fashioned eyeballing, he designs layer after layer to create a complete image, and cuts them with a small knife and a steady hand.  Some cuts are only millimeters across, providing a high level of detail in more complex paintings.  He goes through knife blades like you wouldn't believe.</p>

		<p>After cutting all of the stencil layers, they are carefully placed on canvas and each stencil is given a layer of spraypaint, and the final work begins to take shape.</p>

		<p>His work focuses on the natural world, as well as the very unnatural world of celebrity, drag, and cultural iconism.  Eric Henke doesn't have a cool stencil name, but is always open to suggestions.</p>
